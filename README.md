# Supplementary code: Sætra et al. 2023

This repository contains code to reproduce the main results
presented in Sætra et al. 2023, 
[Neural activity induces strongly coupled electro-chemo-mechanical interactions 
and fluid flow in astrocyte networks and extracellular space – a computational study](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010996).

## Requirements

This code requires that you have the `ffian` package installed, see
[https://github.com/martejulie/fluid-flow-in-astrocyte-networks](https://github.com/martejulie/fluid-flow-in-astrocyte-networks).

## Reproducing the results of the paper

To reproduce Figures 2 - 8 from the paper, run `reproduce_main_results.py`
from the src folder. Note that this might run for a few days on a normal
computer.
